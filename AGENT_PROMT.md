## Continues implement/fix explorer 
```Promt
I am continuing the work on reimplementing the vnstock library in TypeScript. Please read AI_HANDOVER.md to understand the current project state, completed tasks, and known issues.

Based on the handover, I want to focus on the following pending tasks:

1. Standardize Financial Interfaces: The handover notes that FinancialData is not standardized between TCBS and VCI. Please analyze types.ts and the existing implementations to propose a unified interface.
2. Add Unit Tests: Create Jest tests for the new misc and xno modules to ensure reliability.
3. TCBS Listing: Investigate why the listing method in TCBS is incomplete and try to fix it.


Start by reading the handover file and let me know which task you recommend starting with.
